    "c. If the p-value from the statistical test is below a pre-defined significance level (e.g., 0.05), then you can conclude that there is a significant difference in the proportions of driver partners operating in both cities before and after the toll reimbursement policy. This would indicate that the policy has indeed encouraged more driver partners to serve both cities.\n",
    "Caveats would be that maybe the seasons are changing which might affect the traffic, or that something happened in one of the cities such as a power failure and that caused more people to go to the other city. "
